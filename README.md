# PGAP
NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline

The NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline is designed to annotate
bacterial and archaeal genomes (chromosomes and plasmids).

Genome annotation is a multi-level process that includes prediction of
protein-coding genes, as well as other functional genome units such as
structural RNAs, tRNAs, small RNAs and pseudogenes.

NCBI has developed an automatic prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline
that combines ab initio gene prediction algorithms with homology based
methods. The first version of NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Pipeline was developed 
in 2001 and is regularly upgraded to improve structural and functional 
annotation quality ([Li W, O'Neill KR et al 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270901)). Recent 
improvements include utilization of curated protein profile hidden Markov models (HMMs), 
and curated complex domain architectures for functional annotation of proteins and 
annotation of Enzyme Commission numbers and Gene Ontology terms.

## Instructions

To run the PGAP pipeline you will need Linux, or some compatible container technology, CWL (Common
Workflow Language), and about 30GB of supplemental data. We provide
instructions here for running under the CWL reference implementation,
cwltool. Full instructions for installing, running, and interpreting
the results may be found in our [wiki](https://github.com/ncbi/pgap/wiki).
